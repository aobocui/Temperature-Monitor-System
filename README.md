# Temperature-Monitor-System
It is based on 51 micro controller using assembly language.
DS18B20 is used to get the temperature of the environment.
It can display the decimal places of temperature. The resolution of temperature detection is improved.
ZLG7290B is used to show the temperature.
ZLG7290B Keyboard are used to set the upper temperature limit and lower temperature limit.
Once we make mistake when use the keyboard to set the limit as the lower temperature limit it higher than the higher temperature limit,'ee' will be shows on the screen.
If the temperature is higher than the upper temperture or lower than the lower temperature limit, the buzzer will work as an alarm but in different sound to difference different significance.
TLC549 is used for ADC and filter.
Potentiometer is used for changeing the rotate speed of stepper monitor
Serials recieve data per second
Serials could also be used to set the upper and lower temperature limit
